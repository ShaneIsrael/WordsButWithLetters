# Words But With Letters

You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed to run this app locally.

Run the frontend with

```sh
npm start
```

Run the backend server with

```sh
./run_local.sh
```

or

```sh
./reset_and_run_local.sh
```

The reset command deletes the database data and re-migrates it so that it is completely fresh.
